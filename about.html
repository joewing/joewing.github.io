<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
My name is Joe Wingbermuehle.
I live in St. Louis, Missouri with my partner, Ryan, and two cats,
Sam and Zoey.
I graduated from <a href="http://www.mst.edu">UMR</a> in May 2004 with a BS
in Computer Science and a BS in Applied Mathematics.
After school I worked as a software developer for a few years before going
back to get my PhD in Computer Science at
<a href="http://wustl.edu/">WUSTL</a> in 2015.
I am currently principal platform engineer at
<a href="http://wellprincipled.com/">Well Principled</a>.
</p>
<p>
In the past, I've written many TI calculator programs, mostly in z80
assembly language for the <a href="projects/ti83/">TI-83</a>, but also
in 68000 assembly language for both the <a href="projects/ti89/">TI-89</a>
and the <a href="projects/ti92/">TI-92</a>.  More recently, I
wrote a window manager called <a href="projects/jwm/">JWM</a> to
run on the X window system.  I've also built a computer system out of
discrete bipolar transistors called the <a href="projects/q1/">Q1</a>
and then one out of MOSFETs on a PCB called the
<a href="projects/q2/">Q2</a>.
See my <a href="projects/">projects</a> page and my
<a href="https://github.com/joewing">GitHub</a> page for some of my other
projects.
</p>
<p>
My interests include just about everything related to computers,
particularly computer architecture and programming languages.
I also enjoy working with more &quot;vintage&quot; UNIX hardware, such
as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Graphics">SGI</a>
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irix">IRIX</a> on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture">MIPS</a>),
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems">Sun</a>
(<a href="http://www.oracle.com/solaris">Solaris</a> on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARC">SPARC</a>), and
<a href="http://www.hp.com/">HP</a>
(<a href="http://www.hp.com/go/hpux/">HP-UX</a> on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PA-RISC">PA-RISC</a>) systems.
In fact, using an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGI_Octane">SGI Octane</a> as my
desktop in college led me to write JWM in an attempt to have a fast
window manager that was a little more up-to-date than
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4Dwm">4Dwm</a>.
The SGI Octane is one of my favorite systems and I still have one that I use
occasionally.

<h2>A Brief History of This Site</h2>
<p>
I first created this website in 1997.  At that time it was hosted on
Geocities in the "Silicon Valley/Lakes" neighborhood (9309 to be
precise, though if you check it out on archive.org, just remember that it
was the 90s!). Shortly after, I moved the site to my local ISP and from
there to various places until I finally bought "joewing.net" in 2002. This
website is currently hosted by <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>.
