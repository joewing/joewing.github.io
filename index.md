This site is mostly a collection of projects I've worked on in my spare
time over the years. Some of my recent and active projects include:

- [JWM](projects/jwm/)<br>
  A window manager for X11 written in C.
  This is perhaps the oldest project I still maintain (started in 2003).

- [ScalaCad](https://github.com/joewing/ScalaCad)<br>
   Constructive solid geometry in Scala for creating 3D models
   to be printed.

- [Maze Generators](projects/maze/)<br>
  Maze generator implementations in lots of programming languages.

- [The Q2 Computer](projects/q2/)<br>
  A single-board discrete transistor computer.

Some other things I've worked on in the past that may be of interest:

- [TI-83/83+ Assembly Programs](projects/ti83/)<br>
  A collection of TI-83 and TI-83+ programs I wrote in z80 assembly
  language while in high school, including the
  [Ion](projects/ti83/ion/) shell and several games.

- [The Q1 Computer](projects/q1/)<br>
   A computer built almost entirely out of about 3000
   discrete bipolar transistors.

- [Altair 680 on an FPGA](projects/altair680/)<br>
   A complete implementation of the Altair 680 computer system in Verilog
   capable of running a version of BASIC from 1978.

- [ScalaStan](https://github.com/cibotech/scalastan)<br>
   An open-source project I created while working at
   [CiBO Technologies](http://www.cibotechnologies.com/)
   ScalaStan is a wrapper and DSL in Scala for the
   [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) probabilistic programming language.

My [GitHub](https://github.com/joewing) has some more projects.
