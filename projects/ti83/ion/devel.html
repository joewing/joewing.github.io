<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>
Assembling Ion programs requires that you have TASM and Devpac83. You can
get these programs a <a href="http://www.ticalc.org">ticalc.org</a>,
<a href="http://www.calc.org">calc.org</a>, and some <a
href="../../../links.html">other</a> TI calculator web sites. Instead of
using the zasm batch file that comes with Devpac83, use the asm batch file,
which comes with Ion. This program will assemble your code for both the TI-83
and the TI-83 Plus in one step (asm progname).
</p>
<p>
Ion programs are slightly different from SOS or AShell programs. To call a ROM
function, you must use bcall(_function). This is required because of the new
calling conventions on the TI-83 Plus. The rest of this file describes
specific header information for Ion programs as well as some standards. See
the <a href="libs.html">library</a> section for more information on libraries.
Also, check out the source code to my programs if you need some clarification.
</p>

<h2 id="file">File Formats</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Programs</h3>
<p>
All Ion programs must follow the Ion program format in order for Ion to
display them. The format is as follows:
</p>
<pre>
   .nolist              ;\
   #include "ion.inc"   ; \
   .list                ;  \
#ifdef TI83P            ;   \
   .org  progstart-2    ;    | Standard Ion
   .db   $BB,$6D        ;   /  Program Header
#else                   ;  /
   .org  progstart      ; /
#endif                  ;/
   ret                  ; use xor a if libraries are not used
   jr    nc,start       ; jump to the start
                        ; of the program
   .db   "This is the description",0
start:
   ret
.end
.end
</pre>
<p></p>

<h3>Modules</h3>
<p>
Modules are programs that run at Ion startup, shutdown, program selection, and
when an undefined key is pressed in Ion. The format of an Ion module is as
follows:
</p>
<pre>
   .nolist              ;\
   #include "ion.inc"   ; \
   .list                ;  \
#ifdef TI83P            ;   \
   .org  sram-2         ;    | Standard Ion
   .db   $BB,$6D        ;   /  Module Header
#else                   ;  /
   .org  sram           ; /
#endif                  ;/
   ret                  ; modules must not run from the TI-OS
   .db   2              ; identify program type as a module
                        ; NOTE: This used to be a 1 for
                        ; versions prior to v1.3
start:
   ld    a,1            ; normal return
   ret                  ; return when finished
.end
.end
</pre>
<p>
Ion passes values to modules before running them. These values are:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Register a holds the keycode (_getk style). Possible values
      include:
      <ul>
         <li>255 - Ion startup</li>
         <li>1 - Ion restart</li>
         <li>2 - Program selection</li>
         <li>55 - Ion shutdown</li>
         <li>Otherwise the keycode of the key pressed</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li>The op1 memory area holds the name of the highlighted program.
      Use _chksysvar to get program information.</li>
   <li>You may use only saferam2 (statram) and the remaining bytes of
      sram in your module.</li>
   <li>On return, Ion expects a value in register a to determine
      whether or not to restart. If register a equals zero on return, Ion
      will restart immediately. Otherwise, Ion will continue normally.
      Storing zero to register a is not recommended, although possible,
      at startup, shutdown, or restart.</li>
   <li>You cannot use library routines from within modules.</li>
   <li>Modules cannot exceed 768 bytes!</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h3>Libraries</h3>
<p>
Ion has eight built-in library functions. To use these functions, simply call
them (they are defined in ion.inc). See the <a href="libs.html">library</a>
page for more information.
</p>

<h2 id="standards">Standards</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Memory Areas</h3>
<p>
On the TI-83 you may use any memory area for your program except the command
shadow (except for modules; see the section on modules for more information).
On the TI-83 Plus you may only use those areas of RAM that are also allowed on
the TI-83 unless you want to make your program to not be compatible with the
TI-83. To make things easier, ion.inc includes some safe RAM areas with easy
names. They are: saferam1 (768 bytes, APD buffer), saferam2 (512 bytes,
statram), and saferam3 (128 bytes, text memory).
</p>

<h3>Naming Schemes</h3>
<p>
All modules should have the prefix "ZM" at the beginning of the program name.
Regular programs should be named something as similar as possible to their
real name or function.
</p>

<h3>Compatibility Issues (TI-83 vs. TI-83 Plus)</h3>
<p>
The TI-83 Plus has more safe memory areas than the TI-83. It is recommended
that these memory areas not be used unless you plan to do something different
on each calculator or you do not intend on making a TI-83 version of your
program. Unless your program is intended as a Flash utility or other utility
that will only work on one calculator, it is highly recommends that you make
it assemble for either platform. Ion was designed with compatibility in mind
for both calculators. Use the asm batch file (included with Ion) to assemble
your programs. Programs exceeding 8192 bytes may not work properly on the
TI-83 Plus. I am not aware of an easy way around this.
Data may go beyond this 8k limit, but not code. If the executable code in your
program exceeds 8k, try to break it up into segments and load routines into
safe RAM areas as needed.
</p>

<h3>Include Files</h3>
<p>
Ion is packaged with an include file (ion.inc). It is recommenced that you use
this file instead of ti83asm.inc, joeti83p.inc, or another include file. The
Ion include file allows programs to be assembled for both the TI-83 and the
TI-83 Plus in one step. The naming scheme used in this include file is closely
related to TI's naming scheme. See the examples given above for using this
file.
</p>

<h3>Releasing Programs</h3>
<p>
When you release a program, I recommend assembling the program for both the
TI-83 and the TI-83 Plus even if you do not own both calculators. In most
cases, this will require no extra work (if you use the asm batch file included
with Ion). Of course, if your program directly accesses the VAT or another
resource that is different, more changes will be necessary (use #ifdef in
these cases). The program should be named *.83p for the TI-83 version and
*.8xp for the TI-83 Plus version. This is done automatically by asm. I
recommend including a file with your program with the same name, but with the
txt extension for documentation. Lastly, if bugs are found in ion.inc, please
let me know so that I can resolve them.
</p>

<h3>Grouping Programs</h3>
<p>
The asm batch file that comes with Ion does not assemble the TI-83 Plus
version of programs with the correct TI-83 Plus header. Because of this, you
must group your programs as TI-83 programs and not TI-83 Plus programs. To do
this, select "Group TI-83 Programs" and then type *.8* instead of *.83p, which
appears automatically in the program name box. After grouping, name the file
*.8xg for the TI-83 Plus version.
