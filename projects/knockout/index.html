<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
   Knockout is a game for the iPhone/iPod touch. The object is to clear all
   the solid blocks from a level with a ball as fast as possible.<br/>
   I stopped paying for the iOS developer program, so Knockout is no
   longer available via the App Store, but I may make the source available.

<h2>Game Play</h2>
<p>
   Tilt to control the ball's direction. Only one type of block may be cleared
   at a time. When a level is first started or restarted (after loosing a
   ball), dark gray blocks may be cleared. Switch blocks (those blocks with a
   black ball in the center) change the type of block that may be cleared.
   When all other solid blocks are cleared, light gray blocks may be cleared.
   Skull blocks take away one ball and restart the level. Note that it is
   necessary to loose a ball if a switch block is hit before clearing all
   dark gray blocks. Brick blocks cannot be broken.
