<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<p>
This is a quick guide to getting JWM installed and running.  This guide
is intended as a high-level guide to getting started with JWM.
See the <a href="config.html">JWM configuration page</a>
for a comprehensive JWM configuration reference.
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
JWM is distributed in source form (<a href=".">available here</a>),
however, several distributions make JWM available as a binary package.
Note that pre-compiled versions of JWM are often older than the newest
version available here.
To check the version of JWM, run
<span class="nobr">&quot;jwm&nbsp;-v&quot;</span> from a command line.
</p>
<p>
Assuming you are installing JWM from source, after downloading and
expanding the file, run the &quot;configure&quot; script.
</p>
<div class="code">
./configure
</div>
<p>
The configure script will configure JWM for your system.  By default, it
will enable all options provided it can find the appropriate libraries.
You may need to install the &quot;development headers&quot;
for some libraries to compile JWM.  Simply re-run the configure script
after installing any necessary packages.  If you are missing a necessary
library, the configure script will either fail (if the library is
required) or tell you that some feature is disabled.  JWM is installed to
&quot;/usr/local/bin&quot; by default.  The prefix where JWM is installed
(&quot;/usr/local&quot; by default) can be changed using the configure script
if desired using the &quot;--prefix&quot; option.
Run <span class="nobr">&quot;./configure&nbsp;--help&quot;</span> to display
the available configuration options.
</p>
<p>
After successfully running configure, compile JWM by running &quot;make&quot;.
Once JWM is compiled, you can install it by running
<span class="nobr">&quot;make install&quot;</span>
as root (<span class="nobr">&quot;sudo make install&quot;</span>).
</p>

<h2>Starting JWM</h2>
<p>
The preferred method for starting JWM varies depending on distribution
and the display manager used to login.  A common approach is to add the
following line to either &quot;$HOME/.xsession&quot; or
&quot;$HOME/.Xinitrc&quot;:
</p>
<div class="code">
exec /usr/local/bin/jwm
</div>

<p>
This will typically cause JWM to load immediately when X starts (if you
are not using a login manager) or when the &quot;user-defined&quot; login
is selected.
</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>
JWM is configured via an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xml">XML</a>
configuration file.  By default, this file is located in
&quot;/usr/local/etc/system.jwmrc&quot;.  To customize JWM, copy
this file to &quot;$HOME/.jwmrc&quot; and then modify it using your
favorite text editor.
Although somewhat verbose, XML (which looks much like HTML) provides
a convenient way to represent hierarchical configuration, such as menus.
In addition, XML fairly easy to edit either by hand or programmatically.
</p>
<p>
Some distributions divide up the JWM configuration file into multiple
files.  Further, at least on distribution,
<a href="http://puppylinux.org">Puppy Linux</a>, provides tools to
modify the JWM configuration though a graphical interface.
</p>
<p>
The rest of this document will describe how the various sections
of the JWM configuration file work.  Note that the order of
the sections in the configuration file is not important.  However,
it is possible to override settings by specifying them multiple times,
in which case the last setting will be used.
</p>
<p>
Within the JWM configuration file, the top-most &quot;tag&quot;
must be <span class="tag">JWM</span>.  A tag is the thing
that starts with a &quot;&lt;&quot; and ends with a &quot;&gt;&quot;.
All tags must be &quot;closed&quot;, this means that there is
either an end tag (a tag starting with &quot;&lt;/&quot;) following it
or the tag is an &quot;empty-element&quot; tag, meaning it ends with
a &quot;/&gt;&quot;.
All configuration options are nested within the
<span class="tag">JWM</span> tag.
</p>

<h2>Root Menu Configuration</h2>
<p>
JWM can provide one or more &quot;root&quot; menus.  These menus
provide a way for one to start programs.  In the default configuration
distributed with JWM, the root menu can be accessed by clicking on the
desktop or by clicking the &quot;JWM&quot; button in the lower-left
corner of the screen.  Note that you may have a different configuration
if you installed JWM from a binary distribution, such as through
apt or yum.
</p>
<p>
The root menu in the default JWM configuration has several programs in
it, but you will likely want to customize this menu by adding your own
programs.  A root menu is found in the configuration file inside the
<span class="tag">RootMenu</span> tag.  For example, it should look
something like this:
</p>
<div class="code">
   &lt;<span class="tag">RootMenu</span>&nbsp;<span class="attribute">onroot</span>=<span class="literal">&quot;12&quot;</span>&gt;<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<span class="tag">Program</span>&nbsp;<span class="attribute">icon</span>=<span class="literal">&quot;terminal.png&quot;</span> <span class="attribute">label</span>=<span class="literal">&quot;Terminal&quot;</span>&gt;xterm&lt;/<span class="tag">Program</span>&gt;<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<span class="tag">Menu</span> <span class="attribute">icon</span>=<span class="literal">&quot;folder.png&quot;</span> <span class="attribute">label</span>=<span class="literal">&quot;Applications&quot;</span>&gt;<br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<span class="tag">Program</span> <span class="attribute">icon</span>=<span class="literal">&quot;calc.png&quot;</span> <span class="attribute">label</span>=<span class="literal">&quot;Calculator&quot;</span>&gt;xcalc&lt;/<span class="tag">Program</span>&gt;<br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<span class="tag">Program</span> <span class="attribute">icon</span>=<span class="literal">&quot;web-browser.png&quot;</span> <span class="attribute">label</span>=<span class="literal">&quot;Midori&quot;</span>&gt;midori&lt;/<span class="tag">Program</span>&gt;<br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<span class="tag">Program</span> <span class="attribute">icon</span>=<span class="literal">&quot;text-editor.png&quot;</span> <span class="attribute">label</span>=<span class="literal">&quot;XEdit&quot;</span>&gt;xedit&lt;/<span class="tag">Program</span>&gt;<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/<span class="tag">Menu</span>&gt;<br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="comment">&lt;!-- more stuff here --&gt;</span><br />
   &lt;/<span class="tag">RootMenu</span>&gt;
</div>

<p>
Note that &quot;<span class="comment">more stuff here</span>&quot; is an
XML comment, that is, JWM will ignore everything between &quot;&lt;!--&quot;
and &quot;--&gt;&quot;.  Also note that I only included the first part of the
menu here.
</p>
<p>
As shown, the root menu has one program (xterm) that shows up on the main
part of the menu.  The <span class="attribute">icon</span>
&quot;attribute&quot; sets an optional icon to show beside the menu
item.  The <span class="attribute">label</span> attribute sets the label
to use.  If no label is provided, the name of the program is used directly.
Finally, the text inside the &quot;tag&quot; (in this case, &quot;xterm&quot;)
provides the program to run when the menu is clicked.
</p>
<p>
Submenus can also be created.  In the example above, there is one submenu,
introduced by the <span class="tag">Menu</span> tag.  Like programs,
submenus can have an icon and label.  Within the submenu, additional
programs and submenus can be inserted.
</p>
<p>
The look of menus is controlled by the
<span class="tag">MenuStyle</span> section.
See the <a href="config.html">configuration page</a> for details.
</p>

<h2>Trays</h2>
<p>
The default configuration includes a &quot;tray&quot; at the bottom
of the screen.  This tray has a button to display the root menu and
a button show the desktop.  It also contains a pager, which shows
the virtual desktops, a task list, a clock, and a swallowed application
(xload).
It is possible to change the position and layout of this tray.  In
addition, it is possible to create additional trays or completely remove
the tray.  The section in the configuration file in the
<span class="tag">Tray</span> tag defines the default tray.  To add
another tray, simply add another <span class="tag">Tray</span> tag
and set the position as appropriate.
</p>
<p>
The look of the trays is controlled primarily by the
<span class="tag">TrayStyle</span> section.
The look of the pager can be refined using the
<span class="tag">PagerStyle</span> tag.
</p>

<h2>Focus Model</h2>
<p>
JWM supports two focus models: click and sloppy.  The default
focus model is sloppy.  Sloppy focus means that the window the mouse
is over determines which window has focus.  Click focus means that windows
behave as in Windows or Mac OS X, where you must click the window to give
it focus.  To change the focus model, modify the
<span class="tag">FocusModel</span> setting.
</p>

<h2>Desktops</h2>
<p>
The number of desktops is controlled by the <span class="tag">Desktops</span>
tag.  The <span class="attribute">width</span> attribute determines
how many desktops are available horizontally and the
<span class="attribute">height</span> attribute determines how many desktops
are available vertically.
</p>
<p>
In the <span class="tag">Desktops</span> section it is possible to
specify a background for all desktops or each individually.  Further,
it is possible to set names for each desktop.
</p>

<h2>Groups</h2>
<p>
JWM allows one to customize the behavior of windows based upon their
name or &quot;class&quot;.  This is controlled via &quot;groups&quot;.
You can have as many groups as you want.  Each group is introduced by
the <span class="tag">Group</span> tag.
</p>
