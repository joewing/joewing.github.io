    <li>Added group options:
        <span class="literal">nomin</span>,
        <span class="literal">nomax</span>,
        <span class="literal">noclose</span>,
        <span class="literal">nomove</span>,
        <span class="literal">noresize</span> (issue <a href="http://github.com/joewing/jwm/issues/152">#152</a>), and
        <span class="literal">nofullscreen</span> (issue <a href="http://github.com/joewing/jwm/issues/163">#163</a>).
    </li>
    <li>Added the <span class="tag">Outline</span> tag to
        <span class="tag">MenuStyle</span> to specify the color
        of menu outlines (issue <a href="http://github.com/joewing/jwm/issues/31">#31</a>).</li>
    <li>Added the <span class="tag">Outline</span> tag to

        of tray outlines.</li>
    <li>To conform with GNU standards, running &quot;make&nbsp;install&quot;
    no longer strips the executable.  To strip the executable,

    <li>Added the ability to swallow the same client into a tray
    multiple times.</li>
    <li>Added the ability to specify where the tray is hidden when
    auto-hide is enabled (issue <a href="http://github.com/joewing/jwm/issues/34">#34</a>).</li>

    <li>Added the
        <span class="literal">sendu</span>,
        <span class="literal">sendd</span>,
        <span class="literal">sendl</span> and
        <span class="literal">sendr</span>
        key bindings to send a window to a different desktop (issue <a href="http://github.com/joewing/jwm/issues/119">#119</a>).
    </li>
    <li>Added the
        <span class="literal">maxh</span>,
        <span class="literal">maxv</span>,
        <span class="literal">maxtop</span>,
        <span class="literal">maxbottom</span>,
        <span class="literal">maxleft</span> and
        <span class="literal">maxright</span>
        key bindings (issues #120 and #157).
    </li>
    <li>
      Added the ability to have separate actions per mouse button for
      tray buttons (issue <a href="http://github.com/joewing/jwm/issues/171">#171</a>).  This is accomplished using the
      <span class="tag">Button</span> tag.  For example:
<div class="code">
  &lt;<span class="tag">TrayButton</span>&nbsp;<span class="attribute">label</span>=<span class="literal">&quot;My Button&quot;</span>&gt;<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<span class="tag">Button</span>&nbsp;<span class="attribute">mask</span>=<span class="literal">&quot;1&quot;</span>&gt;<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exec:program_for_left_click<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/<span class="tag">Button</span>&gt;<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<span class="tag">Button</span>&nbsp;<span class="attribute">mask</span>=<span class="literal">&quot;45&quot;</span>&gt;<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exec:program_for_scroll_wheel<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/<span class="tag">Button</span>&gt;<br/>
  &lt;/<span class="tag">TrayButton</span>&gt;<br/>
</div>
      The <span class="tag">Button</span> tags are optional.  By default
      the action will use mouse button mask <span class="literal">123</span>.
   </li>
   <li>
      Add the ability to have separate actions per mouse button for
      clock tray components (issue <a href="http://github.com/joewing/jwm/issues/171">#171</a>) and the ability to have
      clock tray components run actions like tray buttons (issue <a href="http://github.com/joewing/jwm/issues/172">#172</a>).
   </li>
   <li>
      Add support for more than 10 menus. Now 26 additional menus can be
      defined using the letters <span class="literal">a</span>
      through <span class="literal">z</span>.
   </li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Configuration Changes</h2>
<p>
    The following XSLT is available to update JWM v2.2 configuration
    files for use with JWM v2.3:
    <a href="xslt/jwm-2.3.xslt">jwm-2.3.xslt</a>.
</p>
<p>
    To convert an existing v2.2 configuration file using
    <a href="http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/xsltproc2.html">xsltproc</a>,
    run:
</p>
<div class="code">
    cp ~/.jwmrc ~/.jwmrc.old<br/>
    xsltproc jwm-2.3.xslt ~/.jwmrc.old &gt; ~/.jwmrc
</div>
<p>
    If you have multiple configuration files, it may be necessary
    to apply the XSLT to some or all of them depending on what
    configuration options are stored in the file.
</p>
<p>
    A summary of configuration changes follows.
</p>
<div>
<ul>
    <li>The <span class="tag">ActiveBackground</span> and
    <span class="tag">ActiveForeground</span> tags have been replaced
    by <span class="tag">Background</span> and
    <span class="tag">Foreground</span> under the
    <span class="tag">Active</span> tag.  This applies to
    <span class="tag">TrayStyle</span>,
    <span class="tag">TaskListStyle</span>,
    <span class="tag">TrayButtonStyle</span>,
    <span class="tag">PagerStyle</span>, and
    <span class="tag">MenuStyle</span>.</li>
    <li>The <span class="tag">Inactive</span> tag under
    <span class="tag">WindowStyle</span> has been removed.  The tags
    that used to go within this tag now go directly under the
    <span class="tag">WindowStyle</span> tag.</li>
    <li>The <span class="attribute">autohide</span> attribute in
    <span class="tag">Tray</span> now determines where the tray should
    be hidden (<span class="literal">left</span>,
    <span class="literal">right</span>,
    <span class="literal">top</span>,
    <span class="literal">bottom</span>, or
    <span class="literal">off</span>) instead of
    <span class="literal">true</span> or <span class="literal">false</span>.
    </li>
    <li>Now actions in the <span class="tag">Clock</span> tag must be
    prefixed with <span class="literal">exec:</span> to run an external
    program.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>
   See the <a href="config.html">configuration documentation</a>
   for documentation on all configuration options.
