<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<p>
This is a collection of major changes between JWM v2.1 and JWM v2.2.<br>
</p>

<h2>New Features</h2>
<div>
<ul>
   <li>Added support for _NET_SHOWING_DESKTOP, _NET_WM_ACTION_ABOVE,
   _NET_WM_ACTION_BELOW, _NET_WM_STATE_SKIP_PAGER, and
   _NET_REQUEST_FRAME_EXTENTS.</li>
   <li>JWM now uses xrender for image scaling</li>
   <li>Added native language support using
   <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/">GNU gettext</a>.</li>
   <li>Added a fullscreen keybinding.</li>
   <li>Added the &quot;-reload&quot; command line option to force
   JWM to reload the menus without restarting.</li>
   <li>Added a <span class="attribute">width</span> attribute to
   docks.</li>
   <li>Better tray support for multiple monitors.</li>
   <li>Added a tray spacer component (<span class="tag">Spacer</span>).</li>
   <li>Added support for changes in root window resolution/orientation.</li>
   <li>JWM now supports resizable icons for window border buttons</li>
   <li>Add support for SVG icons using
   <a href="https://live.gnome.org/LibRsvg/">libRSVG</a> and
   <a href="http://cairographics.org">Cairo</a>.</li>
   <li>Added the <span class="literal">noshade</span> group option</li>
   <li>Minor changes to mouse bindings on window frames.</li>
   <li>Added support for the urgency hint as well as a group option,
   <span class="literal">noturgent</span> to disable it.  JWM will now
   flash the borders of windows that set the urgency hint set unless the
   <span class="literal">noturgent</span> option is set.</li>
   <li>Added <span class="literal">centered</span> and
   <span class="literal">tiled</span> window placement group options.</li>
   <li>Added the <span class="literal">iignore</span> group option
   to ignore increment size hint when maximizing a window.</li>
   <li>Added support for gradients in trays.</li>
   <li>Add the <span class="literal">constrain</span> group option
   to prevent windows from moving themselves off screen.</li>
   <li>It is now possible to use icons of any type for title bar buttons.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Configuration Changes</h2>
<div>
<ul>
   <li>The way windows are associated with groups has changed.  Now within
   a <span class="tag">Group</span> tag, if one or more
   <span class="tag">Name</span> tags is specified, a client window must
   match at least one to be considered part of the group.  Likewise, if one
   or more <span class="tag">Class</span> tags is specified, a program must
   match at least one.  If no tag is specified, all client windows will
   match.</li>
   <li>The name and class fields in <span class="tag">Group</span> tags
   are now treated as POSIX regular expressions.</li>
   <li>The number of supported window layers has been reduced to 3.
   Rather than a number between 0 and 12, JWM now uses
   <span class="literal">above</span>, <span class="literal">normal</span>,
   and <span class="literal">below</span>.</li>
   <li>JWM no longer allows custom window buttons.  These buttons are
   now custom drawn to an appropriate size using X graphics primitives.</li>
   <li>The information in <span class="tag">TrayButtonStyle</span> is
   now inherited from <span class="tag">TrayStyle</span> instead of
   <span class="tag">TaskListStyle</span>.  This means that tray buttons
   now get defaults from the tray instead of from the task list.
   In addition, it is now possible to specify
   <span class="tag">ActiveBackground</span> and
   <span class="tag">ActiveForeground</span> in
   <span class="tag">TrayStyle</span>.  This makes it possible to set
   defaults for both tray buttons and task list buttons in
   <span class="tag">TrayStyle</span>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
