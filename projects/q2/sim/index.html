Online simulator for the <a href="../">Q2</a> computer.

<div class="box">

    Select a program to run:<br>
    <select id="example"></select>
    <button id="run-example">Run</button>

    <input id="custom" type="file" accept=".q2p"></input>

    Since the silk screen is hard to see, the<br>
    control button layout is:
    <pre>
      [Deposit] [ Next  ] (running)
      [ Reset ] [ Stop  ] [ Start ]
    </pre>
  </div>
</div>

Inputs are indicated with red boxes above. To make interaction
easier, the up/left/down/right buttons are mapped to WASD and the
select button is mapped to space.
The simulator is initially halted with the speed switch
set to fast. Click the &quot;Start&quot; button to start the
currently loaded program.
Click the &quot;Fast&quot; switch (located in the center under the
clock generator) to switch between fast (usable) and slow (blinken-light)
modes.
The simulator can be programmed using the switches, though it's
easier to just use one of the examples (or upload a .q2p from
<a href="../asm">q2asm</a>) and click &quot;Run&quot;.
