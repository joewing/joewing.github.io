<h2>NMOS Logic</h2>

<p>
All logic in the Q2 is implemented using n-channel MOSFETs with
resistor pull-ups. Compared to a bipolar logic family like TTL, NMOS is
nice because it requires fewer components: an NMOS inverter requires only
a single transistor and a single pull-up resistor.

<p>
The idea is pretty simple: a voltage present at the gate (pin 1)
of the MOSFET exceeding the threshold voltage (Vth) allows current
to flow from the drain (pin 3) to the source (pin 2). The transistor
acts as a variable resistor until the gate voltage increases to the
drain voltage (Vds) minus Vth, at which point the transistor is
completely on (saturated).
Since we use NMOS devices, this means that a high voltage at the
gate will pull the output to ground. On the other hand, a low voltage
at the gate will turn off the transistor, allowing the pull-up
resistor to bring the output high.
</p>

<p>
A complication of discrete NMOS logic is introduced through the use
of three-terminal devices where the bulk terminal is tied to the
source terminal. This creates a parasitic diode between the drain
in the source. The diode doesn't present too many issues, but it can
lead to surprises.
For instance, to make a pass transistor gate you need two transistors
instead of one.
Note that when designing an IC you get to tie the bulk to ground
instead of the source, which eliminates the diode. Thus it is
important to be wary of circuits that come from a VLSI textbook.
</p>

<h2>Speed</h2>

<p>
The resistor pull-up presents a trade-off between speed and power, where
a lower value resistor pull-up will make the gate faster at the expense
of more power draw when the output is low. The situation is made worse
by the fact that most modern discrete MOSFETs have a rather high
gate capacitance (likely because they are made for switching large loads
rather than implementing logic), making fast logic tricky to implement
without using excessive power.
</p>

<p>
Although NMOS has a nearly unlimited fanout due to the high impedance
between the input and output, the gate capacitance
means that as we increase the fanout, the propagation delay increases. For
the Q2, we try to use mostly 10k pull-up resistors as a compromise between
speed and power. If we assume a load of 50pF and a Vth of 2.5 (pessimistic
values for the gate capacitance and threshold voltage of a 2N7002), this
gives us a propagation delay of around 347ns and a current draw of 0.5mA
at 5V for a fanout of one. As the fanout increases to, for example, 24 to
clock the A register, the propagation delay increases to 8.32us just for
the last level of logic. If we wanted to clock the Q2 at 100kHz, this
would leave us only 1.68us of slack for all other logic.
To avoid such issues, we track the fanout and insert 1k resistors instead
of 10k resistors in strategic locations, which in this case brings the delay
down to 832ns with a draw of 5mA.
</p>

<h2>Power</h2>

<p>
Since USB adapters are prevalent and provide an easy
5v power source, the Q2 was designed to use USB for
power. In general, this limits the power consumption
to be 500mA.
It is relatively easy to verify that the Q2 will
not draw too much power.
</p>

<p>
The primary source of power consumption in the Q2 comes from pull-up
networks. For simplicity, most of the pull-ups are simply resistors,
though some of them have an LED in series to show state. We can easily
compute the worse-case power draw by assuming all the pull-up networks
are grounded using Ohm's law. The power consumption varies depending on
the value of the resistor and the presence of the LED:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>LED (2V drop) with 1k resistors: (5 - 2) / 1000 = 3mA</li>
  <li>1k resistor: 5 / 1000 = 5mA</li>
  <li>4.7k resistor: 5 / 4700 = 1.06mA</li>
  <li>10k resistor: 5 / 10000 = 0.5mA
  <li>100k resistor: 5 / 100000 = 0.05mA
</ul>

<p>
From this we get 442mA from pull-up networks.
This provides an absolute worst-case estimate since
we don't expect all gates and LEDs to be drawing
power at all times (gates only draw power when the
output is low).
<p>

<p>
We assume the two RAM chips use a total of 20mA and the LCD uses 25mA.
So we get a total worst-case draw of 487mA or 2.4 Watts.
