<h2>NMOS Logic</h2>

<p>
All logic in the Q2 is implemented using 2N7002 n-channel MOSFETs with
resistor pull-ups. Compared to a bipolar logic family like TTL, NMOS is
nice because it requires fewer components: an NMOS inverter requires only
a single transistor and a single pull-up resistor. Unfortunately, the
resistor pull-up presents a trade-off between speed and power, where
a lower value resistor pull-up will make the gate faster at the expense
of more power draw when the output is low. The situation is made worse
by the fact that most modern discrete MOSFETs have a rather high
gate capacitance (likely because they are made for switching large loads
rather than implementing logic), making fast logic tricky to implement
without using excessive power.
</p>

<p>
Although NMOS has a nearly unlimited fanout due to the high impedance
between the input and output, the gate capacitance
means that as we increase the fanout, the propagation delay increases. For
the Q2, we try to use mostly 10k pull-up resistors as a compromise between
speed and power. If we assume a load of 50pF and a Vth of 2.5 (pessimistic
values for the gate capacitance and threshold voltage of a 2N7002), this
gives us a propagation delay of around 347ns and a current draw of 0.5mA
at 5V for a fanout of one. As the fanout increases to, for example, 24 to
clock the A register, the propagation delay increases to 8.32us just for
the last level of logic. If we wanted to clock the Q2 at 100kHz, this
would leave us only 1.68us of slack for all other logic.
To avoid such issues, we track the fanout and insert 1k resistors instead
of 10k resistors in strategic locations, which in this case brings the delay
down to 832ns with a draw of 5mA.
</p>

<h2>Power</h2>

<p>
Since USB adapters are prevalent and provide an easy
5v power source, the Q2 was designed to use USB for
power. In general, this limits the power consumption
to be 500mA.
It is relatively easy to verify that the Q2 will
not draw too much power.
</p>

<p>
Each LED is driven through a 4.7k resistor. We assume
a 2v voltage drop through each LED, giving us a power
draw of 0.64mA per LED.
Each gate uses a 10k, a 1k, or a 100k resistor pull-up
(depending on the fanout and required speed), so we
assume 0.5mA for each 10k resistor and 5mA for each
1k resistor, and 0.05mA for each 100k resistor.
This provides an absolute worst-case estimate since
we don't expect all gates and LEDs to be drawing
power at all times (gates only draw power when the
output is low). We assume the RAM chips and
LCD each use 20mA.
This gives us:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>71 LEDs = 45mA</li>
  <li>376 10k resistors = 188mA</li>
  <li>19 100k resistors = 1mA</li>
  <li>17 1k resistors = 85mA</li>
  <li>2 RAM chips and 1 LCD = 60mA</li>
</ul>

<p>
So we get a total worst-case draw of 379mA or 1.9 Watts.
