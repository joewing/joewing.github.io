The RAM for the Q2 is the one notable piece that is not
implemented out of discrete transistors. The goal was to
have a RAM that could save programs when powered off and
be implemented without substantially increasing the size or
power consumption of the Q2.
A DRAM structure was considered
(with large enough capacitors, DRAM will persist for a
reasonable amount of time), but even that would require two
transistors per bit, not to mention the address decoding logic
and sense amplifiers.
An actual core memory would be the most appropriate, but
such things are hard to find, and the assembly of one does
not appeal to me.
So given that an off-the-shelf SRAM already provides
exactly what we need, the Q2 goes that route.

<p>
The RAM for the Q2 is provided by two 6264 SRAM chips. Each
of these has an 8-bit data bus and a 13-bit address bus.
Since we only need 12 bits for the data bus, two of the
data pins on each are pulled to GND via 100k resistors. This
provides a stable value for writes and low-current draw during
reads. The extra address bit is connected to a bank select switch,
allowing two complete system images to be stored on the Q2.

An SRAM battery backup is provided for the SRAM to preserve
any programs when the Q2 is not powered.
