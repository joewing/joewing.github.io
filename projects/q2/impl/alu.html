The ALU is bit-serial to reduce transistor count. During the 12 ALU
states, the bits from A and X are shifted through the ALU least-significant
first, and back to A. Depending on the opcode, the flag register tracks the
carry or zero status.
The ALU supports the following operations:

      <td>X0</td><td>X0 &amp; ~F</td>

      <td>x01</td><td>NOR</td>
      <td>~(A0 | X0)</td><td>(A0 | X0) &amp; ~F</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>x10</td><td>ADD</td>
      <td>A0 + X0 + F</td><td>(A0 &amp; X0) | (A0 &amp; F) | (X0 &amp; F)</td>
    </tr>

      <td>x11</td><td>SHR</td>
      <td>X1</td><td>F</td>

The NOR function is easily implemented with two transistors.

To compute the sum, a standard binary full-adder made out of NAND
gates is used. There are a few minor departures to save transistors:
when two NAND gates share an input on the ground-side, the ground-side
transistor can be shared. A common NMOS/CMOS adder design would save
an additional transistor, but at the expense of an increased load on
the A, X, and F registers, which we want to avoid.

The ALU output selection is based on two bits from the opcode
(note that LEA and LDA both have the same ALU function).
The ALU uses these two bits to determine which output to use.

Finally, the ALU flag output also uses two bits from the
opcode. Here the load and NOR operations clear the flag when
a non-zero value is detected. The carry from the adder is
used for ADDs, and the flag is preserved for shift right,
(the flag will be set to X0 prior to the ALU state for shift right).
