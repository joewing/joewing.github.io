<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<h2>Run Latch</h2>

<p>
The run latch controls whether the Q2 clock is enabled. The run latch
consists of a pair of cross-coupled inverters (2 transistors). Pressing
the &quot;Stop&quot; button pulls the <span class="not">STOP</span> signal
to ground and pressing the &quot;Start&quot; button pulls the
<span class="not">START</span> signal to ground causing the
<span class="not">STOP</span> signal to go high.
The <span class="not">STOP</span> signal is connected to
<span class="not">RST</span> through a diode,
which has the effect of pressing &quot;Stop&quot; when the Q2 is reset.

<h2>Clock Generation</h2>

<p>
The clock for the Q2 is generated using a 3-stage ring
oscillator with a variable delay. The output of the clock is fed
through an inverter to reduce load on the oscillator and preserve the
phase, which should be high when not running. To halt
the clock, an additional transistor gates the first stage.

<p>
The clock is divided into two non-overlapping clock phases: a state
clock (SC) and a write strobe (WS). The phases are generated using
the CDIV flip-fop and two NOR gates.
The SC clock is used to advance the state machine and the WS clock
is used to clock the other flip-flops and write to memory.
Having two phases simplifies writes to memory and I/O. Further,
it allows the state machine to be implemented as a simple binary
ripple counter (otherwise the ripple would cause glitches).

The starting sequence of clock phases looks like this:

Here the Q2 powers up with the reset button pressed
(nrst = 0). The reset button is released and then the
start button is pressed to start the clock (nstart = 0).
