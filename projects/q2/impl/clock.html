<h2>Run Latch</h2>

<p>
The run latch controls whether the Q2 clock is enabled. The run latch
consists of a pair of cross-coupled inverters (2 transistors). Pressing
the &quot;Halt&quot; button pulls the &quot;Run&quot; signal to ground
and pressing the &quot;Run&quot; button pulls the other side to ground
causing the RUN signal to go high.
The &quot;Halt&quot; button is connected to ground through a capacitor,
which has the effect of pressing &quot;Halt&quot; when power is applied
so the Q2 comes up halted.

<h2>Clock Generation</h2>

<p>
The clock for the Q2 is generated using a simple relaxation oscillator
constructed from a Schmitt trigger. The Schmitt trigger itself is
implemented using 3 2N7002 transistors. The output of the clock is
fed through two inverters to reduce load on the oscillator and
preserve the phase, which should be high when not running. To halt
the clock, an additional transistor gates the Schmitt trigger.

<p>
Being implemented using only NMOS transistors, the Schmitt
trigger is identical to the pull-down half of the traditional
CMOS Schmitt trigger design with a pull up resistor (R128).
An additional resistor (R132) is used to control the hysteresis
window. Larger value resistors will reduce the size of the
hysteresis window and conserve power. A smaller window
allows the oscillator to run faster, though too small of
a window and it will become unstable and eventually stop working.
</p>

<p>
The clock is divided into two non-overlapping clock phases: a state
clock (SC) and a write strobe (WS). The phases are generated using
the CDIV flip-fop and two NOR gates.
The SC clock is used to advance the state machine and the WS clock
is used to clock the other flip-flops and write to memory.
Having two phases simplifies writes to memory and I/O. Further,
it allows the state machine to be implemented as a simple binary
ripple counter (otherwise the ripple would cause glitches).

The starting sequence of clock phases looks like this:
