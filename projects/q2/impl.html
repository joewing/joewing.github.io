title: Q2 Implementation Details

<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<h2>Run Latch</h2>

<p>
The run latch controls whether the Q2 clock is enabled. The run latch
consists of a pair of cross-coupled inverters (2 transistors). Pressing
the &quot;Halt&quot; button pulls the &quot;Run&quot; signal to ground
and pressing the &quot;Run&quot; button pulls the other side to ground
causing the RUN signal to go high.
The &quot;Halt&quot; button is connected to ground through a capacitor,
which has the effect of pressing &quot;Halt&quot; when power is applied
so the Q2 comes up halted.
</p>

<h2>Clock Generation</h2>

<p>
The clock for the Q2 is generated using a simple relaxation oscillator
constructed from a Schmitt trigger. The Schmitt trigger itself is
implemented using 3 2N7002 transistors. The output of the clock is
fed through two inverters to reduce load on the oscillator and
preserve the phase, which should be high when not running.
</p>

<p>
The clock is divided into two non-overlapping clock phases: a state
clock (SC) and a write strobe (WS). The phases are generated using
the CDIV flip-fop and two NOR gates.
The SC clock is used to advance the state machine and the WS clock
is used to clock the other flip-flops and write to memory.
Having two phases simplifies writes to memory and I/O. Further,
it allows the state machine to be implemented as a simple binary
ripple counter (otherwise, the ripple would cause glitches).
</p>

<h2>State Machine</h2>

<p>
The state machine is advanced on the rising edge of the SC clock.
There are 16 states. To reduce transistor count, the state machine
is implemented as a 4-bit binary ripple counter. Since not all
instructions use all states, the state decoder masks states
that are not used. This means all instructions take the same
number of clocks to execute.
</p>

<p>
The states are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>FETCH - Fetch the next instruction.</li>
  <li>DEREF - Dereference the operand if the dereference bit is set.</li>
  <li>LOAD - Load the operand from memory if this is an ALU instruction.</li>
  <li>EXEC - Execution the instruction or prepare the ALU.</li>
  <li>ALU - 12 states to run the 12 bits of A and X through the ALU.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Arithmetic Logic Unit</h2>

<p>
The ALU is bit-serial to reduce transistor count. During the 12 ALU
states, the bits from A and X are shifted through the ALU least-significant
first, and back to A. Depending on the opcode, the flag register tracks the
carry or zero status.
The ALU supports the following operations:
</p>

<table class="listing">
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Opcode</th><th>Name</th><th>Next A</th><th>Next F</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>x00</td><td>LDA</td>
      <td>X0</td><td>X0 &amp; ~F</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>x01</td><td>NOR</td>
      <td>~(A0 | X0)</td><td>(A0 | X0) &amp; ~F</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>x10</td><td>ADD</td>
      <td>A0 + X0 + F</td><td>(A0 &amp; X0) | (A0 &amp; F) | (X0 &amp; F)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>x11</td><td>SHR</td>
      <td>X1</td><td>F</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Program Counter (P)</h2>

<p>
The program counter is made up of 12 positive-edge-triggered D-flip-flops
configured as a 12-bit binary ripple counter. Incrementing the program
counter is accomplished by clocking the least-significant bit. To load
the program counter, either for a jump or at reset, the flip-flops also
have set/reset inputs.
</p>

<h2>Power</h2>

<p>
Since USB adapters are prevalent and provide an easy
5v power source, the Q2 was designed to use USB for
power. In general, this limits the power consumption
to be 500mA.
It is relatively easy to verify that the Q2 will
not draw too much power.
</p>

<p>
Each LED is driven through a 4.7k resistor. We assume
a 2v voltage drop through each LED, giving us a power
draw of 0.64mA per LED.
Each gate uses either a 10k or a 1k (depending on the
fanout and required speed) resistor pull-up, so we
assume 0.5mA for each 10k resistor and 5mA for each
1k resistor. This provides an absolute worst-case
estimate since we don't expect all gates and LEDs
to be drawing power at all times.
We assume the RAM chips and LCD each use 20mA.
This gives us:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>72 LEDs = 46mA</li>
  <li>404 10k resistors = 202mA</li>
  <li>7 1k resistors = 35mA</li>
  <li>2 RAM chips and 1 LCD = 60mA</li>
</ul>

<p>
So we get a total worst-case draw of 343mA or 1.7 Watts.
